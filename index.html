				<p>FUN Fact: Based on our estimates if all nz houses switch to LED it could save 40 million kWh a month</p>
					<br>LEDs are the most efficient and longest-lasting lighting option and good for all general household use. 
					Whilst they cost a bit more upfront, over their life the energy savings make up for that many times over. 
					<br><br> Each LED bulb you buy to replace an incandescent light bulb can save you between $100 and $300 over its life (depending on the wattage of the bulb you replace).

				<div>
					Where to buy:<br> Most hardware stores, supermarkets and specialty lighting stores sell LEDs. <br>

				Solar Panels: <br><br> 
				<div> 
					Solar electricity is silent and unobtrusive, and can be used all around the country. The main barrier to its uptake is cost.

					<br><br>Types of heat pump: <br><br>
				</div>
				
				<div>Single-split systems are the most common heat pumps in New Zealand - they are air-to-air, 
				with one indoor unit connected to an outdoor unit. These systems are designed to heat just the room that they are installed in,
				not the whole house. While leaving internal doors open may allow some of the heated air to travel into other rooms,
				in most houses this does not work very well, particularly if there is a hallway in between,
				if there are high ceilings or if the house needs a lot of heating.
				</div> <br>
				
				<div>Multi-split heat pumps are designed to heat multiple rooms -
				and consist of one outdoor unit serving multiple indoor units installed in different rooms of the house.
				</div> <br>
				
				<div>Ducted heat pumps provide central heating - by blowing heated air through ducts into multiple rooms of a house.
				While some can only be controlled centrally, others allow you to choose which rooms or groups of rooms you want to be heated at any given time (zoning).
				For example, you may only want to have your bedrooms heated overnight.

			<div id="InfoConventionalOvens" class="hide">
				<br><br>Convection ovens also make a difference. The heated air is continuously circulated which reduces cook times as well as the temperatures required.
				On average you'll use 20% less energy a month running your convection oven, as compared to a standard oven.
